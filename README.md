# Modern_Three_dimensional_ambiguity_plot_for_an_LFM_pulse_train
This repository provides an implementation to generate a three-dimensional ambiguity plot for a Linear Frequency Modulated (LFM) pulse train. 
The ambiguity function is a powerful tool for analyzing the time-frequency characteristics of signals, providing insights into resolution and detection performance.
